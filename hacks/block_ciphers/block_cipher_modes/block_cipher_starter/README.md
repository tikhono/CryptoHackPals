[CryptoHack â€“ Block Ciphers challenges](https://cryptohack.org/challenges/aes/)

> The previous set of challenges showed how AES performs a keyed permutation on a block of data. In practice, we need to encrypt messages much longer than a single block. A _block cipher mode of operation_ describes how to use a cipher like AES on such messages.
>
> All block cipher modes have serious weaknesses when used incorrectly. The challenges in this category take you to a different section of the website where you can interact with APIs and exploit those weaknesses. Get yourself acquainted with the interface and use it to take your next flag!
