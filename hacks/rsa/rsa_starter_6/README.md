> How can you ensure that the person receiving your message knows that you wrote it?
>
> You've been asked out on a date, and you want to send a message telling them that you'd love to go, however a jealous lover isn't so happy about this.
>
> When you send your message saying yes, your jealous lover intercepts the message and corrupts it so it now says no!
>
> We can protect against these attacks by signing the message.
>
> Imagine you write a message `M`. You encrypt this message with your **friend's public key**: `C = Me0 mod N0`.
>
> To sign this message, you calculate the hash of the message: `H(M)` and "encrypt" this with **your private key**: `S = H(M)d1 mod N1`.
>
> In real cryptosystems, it's [best practice to use separate keys](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/12138) for encrypting and signing messages.
>
> Your friend can decrypt the message using **their private key**: `m = Cd0 mod N0`. Using your public key they calculate `s = Se1 mod N1`.
>
> Now by computing `H(m)` and comparing it to `s`: `assert H(m) == s`, they can ensure that the message you sent them, is the message that they received!
>
> Sign the flag `crypto{Immut4ble_m3ssag1ng}` using your private key and the SHA256 hash function.

> ### How to:
> Run all tests from this package:
>
>     cargo test --package rsa_starter_6 --lib tests
>
> Capture the flag:
>
>     cargo test --package rsa_starter_6 --lib tests::capture_the_flag -- --exact
