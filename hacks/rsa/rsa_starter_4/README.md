> The private key `d` is used to decrypt ciphertexts created with the corresponding public key (it's also used to "sign" a message but we'll get to that later).
>
> The private key is the secret piece of information or "trapdoor" which allows us to quickly invert the encryption function. If RSA is implemented well, if you do not have the private key the fastest way to decrypt the ciphertext is to first factorise the modulus.
>
> In RSA the private key is the [modular multiplicative inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse) of the exponent `e` modulo the totient of `N`.

> `e = 65537`

> What is the private key `d`?

> ### How to:
> Run all tests from this package:
>
>     cargo test --package rsa_starter_4 --lib tests
>
> Capture the flag:
>
>     cargo test --package rsa_starter_4 --lib tests::capture_the_flag -- --exact
