> All operations in RSA involve [modular exponentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_exponentiation).
>
> Modular exponentiation is an operation that is used extensively in cryptography and is normally written like: `210 mod 17`
>
> You can think of this as raising some number to a certain power (`210 = 1024`), and then taking the remainder of the division by some other number (`1024 mod 17 = 4`). In Python there's a built-in operator for performing this operation: `pow(base, exponent, modulus)`
>
> In RSA, modular exponentiation, together with the problem of prime factorisation, helps us to build a "[trapdoor function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapdoor_function)". This is a function that is easy to compute in one direction, but hard to do in reverse unless you have the right information. It allows us to encrypt a message, and only the person with the key can perform the inverse operation to decrypt it.

> Run all tests from this package:
>
>     cargo test --package rsa_starter_1 --lib tests
>
> Capture the flag:
>
>     cargo test --package rsa_starter_1 --lib tests::capture_the_flag -- --exact
