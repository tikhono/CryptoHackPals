> Now you've got the hang of the various encodings you'll be encountering, let's have a look at automating it.
>
> Can you pass all 100 levels to get the flag?
>
> The _13377.py_ file attached below is the source code for what's running on the server. The _pwntools\_example.py_ file provides the start of a solution using the incredibly convenient pwntools library. which you can use if you like. pwntools however is incompatible with Windows, so _telnetlib\_example.py_ is also provided.
