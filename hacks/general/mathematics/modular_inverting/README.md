> As we've seen, we can work within a finite field `Fp`, adding and multiplying elements, and always obtain another element of the field.
>
> For all elements `g` in the field, there exists a unique integer `d` such that `g * d ≡ 1 mod p`.
>
> This is the multiplicative inverse of `g`.
>
> **Example**: `7 * 8 = 56 ≡ 1 mod 11`
>
> What is the inverse element: `3 * d ≡ 1 mod 13`?
>
> > Think about the little theorem we just worked with. How does this help you find the inverse of an element?
